Hi,
My name is Igal Achourov and this is my repository search project.
Client created using angular 8, and .Net core 3 for server.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server inside `RepositorySeeker-SPA`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
 The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. 
and for the server please enter `RepositorySeeker.API` enter the command `dotnet run`. 


enjoy :)
